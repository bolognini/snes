# The ultimate collection of remastered PAL Super Nintendo covers. 

This project has taken over a year to complete, painstakingly restoring, remastering and recreating all of the boxart/covers of the SNES games I loved as a kid. What makes this collection different to others that are out there is that I've both kept every one consistent to the same PAL template dimensions, but have also created PAL style covers for ALL of the American NTSC titles also.

This meant hours of restorative painting work, filling in gaps where ugly black boxes covered beautiful artwork on the USA covers, sourcing original artwork that may have been used on a certain cover, or just plain frankenstein-patchworking many many many different sources together until they looked perfect.

Originally started as a project to replace the American covers of the SNES Mini, it became extremely addictive... and after finishing off all of the PAL covers, the NTSC collection was soon in my sights.

I've tried to keep everything as authentic as possible, using the correct manufacturer/publisher logos, placements, and also find the highest resolution images that I possibly could for each and every game. Sometimes the only scan I could find was from 20+ years ago and a 300x200 grainy and artifact filled jpeg, making it difficult to get a clean cover. 

I'm extremely happy with 98% of these covers, but there are definitely some blurry/crappy ones in amongst the good ones. If you have a sharper scan of any of the covers you see, please let me know via the Issues register and I will get to work and get your better version into the collection ASAP!

Enjoy!
